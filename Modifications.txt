Unity Scripting exercise
Added functionalities from part 2:
•	Visuals: a heart appears, rotates, floats and disappears.
•	Keeping Score: In the screen appears the total of sheep hit, and the sheep dropped. When a sheep drops, the game ends.
•	Title Screen Buttons: The Player can start the game again by pressing Start with the mouse or Quit to exit.
Other small changes:
•	I added that the game ends also when the Player hits 5 sheep.
•	A text appears on the screen “Hit 5 sheep to win!”.
•	The velocity of the sheep is higher.
